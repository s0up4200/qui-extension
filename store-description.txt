qui — Add torrents to qBittorrent from your browser.

Right-click any magnet link or .torrent URL and send it directly to your qBittorrent instances managed by a qui server. Pick the instance and category from nested context menus — no extra tabs or copy-pasting required.

Features:
• Multi-instance support — manage multiple qBittorrent instances from one extension
• Category selection — choose the target category per torrent on the fly
• Favorites — star frequently used instance/category pairs for quick access in the popup
• Notifications — instant feedback confirming the torrent was added or showing errors
• Minimal permissions — only requests access to the server URL you configure

Setup:
1. Install and open the extension options
2. Enter your qui server URL and API key
3. Grant host permission to your server
4. Right-click any magnet or torrent link and pick an instance/category

Requires a running qui server (https://github.com/autobrr/qui).
